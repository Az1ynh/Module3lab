#Problem 4
#This will solve the area of the circle
radius = float(input("Please enter the radius of the circle")) #asking the user to enter the radius
area = math.pi * float(radius**2) #asking to enter the area

#Problem 5
#This will calculate the mpg per gallon of a vehicle
miles = float(input("Please enter the number of miles driven")) #Asking the user for the miles
gallons = float(input("Please enter the number of gallons used"))#asking for the gallons
mpg = miles/gallons #the formula to find the mpg

#Problem 6
#This code will convert the degrees fahrenheit to degrees celsius
fahrenheit = float(input("Please enter the temperature fahrenheit")) #Asking the user for the degrees in fahrenheit
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9 #The formula to convert to celsius
print("The temperature in Celsius is", celsius, "degrees") #Showing the results
